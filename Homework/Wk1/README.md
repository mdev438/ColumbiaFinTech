# FinTech Case Study - TransferWise

## Overview and Origin

* TransferWise

* Founded in 2011

* Kristo Käärmann and Taavet Hinrikus

* The two founders had to work between Estonia and the U.K. and hated dealing with the international money transfer system, 
 leading them to create a solution for their struggles.

* The company was initially crowdsourced, but later on investors also bought in totaling in funding of $117 million USD 


## Business Activities:

* The company aims to offer an easier and more cost-effective method to transfer and send money across the globe

* The company's site list the application as perfect for users who "live and work in multiple currencies" While there is no
information of how large this market is, the app boasts over six million users. In comparison to its competitors, TransferWise offers rates that are fractions of their competitors while keeping the same level of service.

* The main technology used in this application are ACH pull and ACH push to transfer and receive money


## Landscape:

* Transferwise falls under the financial services category, mainly concerned with transferring or converting money

* Over the last 10 years, rates have been falling consistently however TransferWise offers much lower prices to its customers

* Transferwise's main competitors are banks (e.g Chase, CitiBank, Wells Fargo)


## Results

* This company has disrupted the field as it uses peer to peer transfers to keep its costs so low which created its large user
base

* Some metrics companies in this field might use to measure their success are the amount of users that they have along with
the different currencies that they can allow one user to hold within their account

* TransferWise is at the top of its field having over 6 million users, and granting each one of them to hold over 40 currency
balances


## Recommendations

* If I was to advise TransferWise, I would tell them to bring cryptocurrency transactions to their platform

* Due to the sheer size of their customer base, I think they would be able to profit if they use their same peer to peer
transaction method

* This would have to add cryptocurrency wallets and blockchain for transfers

* These technologies are currently what is used to execute cryptocurrency transactions
